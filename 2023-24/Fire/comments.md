The merge conflict in the source code was a hint to check for the existence of a publically exposed .git subdirectory. You can reconstruct the entire source code once you have all the git files. As an extra challenge, I had also deleted the HEAD file in the .git folder.

PS: I've renamed ".git" to "[dot]git" in this repo to prevent it from interfering.
