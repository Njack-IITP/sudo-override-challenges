No, we don't have an art theme for this ctf, but I can't resist myself from telling you about the famous Dutch painter Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan. He is regarded as one of the greatist astists of the 20th century. He is known for being one of the pioneers of 20th-century abstract art, as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements.

I present to you three paintings.
