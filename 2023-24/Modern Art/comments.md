Provided are three paintings. The third one is quite odd both with respect to name and content. 
  
The content is a cursive x, and since this is an OSINT problem it hints about X(formerly twitter).
  
The name is pieter07031872_estoric_art. The first part is the username of the twitter account while the second part is to hint about esoteric programming languages.

The first post is the image to proceed ahead. Save it. 

Now, the original hint was esoteric prog. languages. One of the most beautiful of them is Piet(named after the same painter the pquestion revolved).

So, yo just need to find a Piet interpreter and run the image. (In piet, images are codes)

Here's a good online interpreter: https://www.bertnase.de/npiet/npiet-execute.php

Here you go !

PS: It was really tiresome to create the code(image) that prints this flag.
