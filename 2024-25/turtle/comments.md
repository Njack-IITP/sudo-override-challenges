The statement mentions a certain Yashvi Ji (SVG) and references paths, hinting at a relation to the SVG path element. The file strange.txt contains a string of numbers and letters beginning with "P." This string resembles the d attribute of an SVG path element, which outlines the points to be drawn. Researching SVGs reveals that a valid input always starts with "M" (Move To), whereas the string in strange.txt starts with "P." This indicates the letters have been shifted using ROT3. By shifting the letters back by 3 spots and placing the output string in an SVG element with and sufficiently large viewBox, the flag will be revealed.
